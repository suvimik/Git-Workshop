  When Marin got back with their turtle, Mark and Cecilia had already met. While
  the coder was standing in front of the mirror adjusting their html, Wayne was sitting on the hallway floor wondering
  whether the food would be enough or whether they should ask their mum for
an extra hot dog.
      </p>
      <p>
        "Oh finally!" the coder sighed when <span class="fillslot">Harry</span>, dressed as <span
          class="fillslot">a rock star</span>, opened the front door. "What took you so long?" <span
          class="fillslot">the coder</span> asked.
      </p>
      <p>
        "<span class="fillslot">The walk</span> took longer than I thought", <span class="fillslot">Harry</span>
        moaned in frustration holding <span class="fillslot">the turtle</span> dressed as <span class="fillslot">teenage mutant ninja turtle</span>.
        "How was <span class="fillslot">the candy hunt</span>?
        Did you <span class="fillslot">score</span> while I was gone?" <span class="fillslot">Marin</span> asked.
      </p>
      <p>
  "<span class="fillslot">Yasss</span>.
  But <span class="fillslot">pray for us</span>!
  Otherwise we'll get apples or something when people run out of candy", <span
  class="fillslot">Mark</span> snapped, stood up and straightened their <span class="fillslot">Bowie</span> costume.
        "Come on, let's go!"
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>
        <span class="fillslot">Friday</span> A few minutes later...</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        "<span class="fillslot">Huzzah!</span>. Our neighbors were already almost out of candy!", <span
          class="fillslot">Marin</span> huffs and
          shoots an angry look at <span class="fillslot">Mark</span>.
      </p>
      <p>
        "We could go to <span class="fillslot">Bourbon Street</span>",
        <span class="fillslot">Mark</span> proposes. "They
        are quite a few houses there and most kids don't go there."
      </p>
      <p>
        "Yeah because <span class="fillslot">it sucks</span>!",
        <span class="fillslot">the coder</span> states with a worried look on their face.
        They won't admit it to their friends but they are actually a little bit afraid of <span
          class="fillslot">owls</span>.
      </p>
      <p>
        "What's the big deal? You're not afraid of the <span class="fillslot">whiskey</span>, are you?",
         <span class="fillslot">the coder</span> smirked.
      </p>
      <p>
        "Of course I'm not!" <span class="fillslot">Mark</span> scoffs but looks still nervous.
      </p>
      <p>
        "Well let's just go then! Let's get that candy!" <span class="fillslot">the coder</span> says sounding <span
          class="fillslot">entertained</span>. They start leading the group towards <span class="fillslot">eternal doom</span>. <span
          class="fillslot">Cecilia</span> hesitates for <span class="fillslot">a hot minute</span> and then sprints after the
        others.
