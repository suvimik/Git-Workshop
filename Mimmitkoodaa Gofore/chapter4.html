      In the house

    <p>
      The house smelled like <span class="fillslot">cardamom</span> and <span class="fillslot">fresh coffee</span> as the kids
      walk across the <span class="fillslot">haunted</span> hall. The house seems to be empty but still they can't help
      feeling like <span class="fillslot">something evil is lurking somwhere</span>.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Look! That door is open!" <span class="fillslot">The youngest one</span> points to a door <span
        class="fillslot">Cecilias pet</span>.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Could <span class="fillslot">C's pet</span> could have gone there? Maybe they already returned outside...", <span
        class="fillslot">from the graveyard</span> whispers their voice trembling.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No they definitely are here", says <span class="fillslot">looking white</span> who has reached the open door first. "I
      can
      see their footsteps in the dust. And they are only going one way...", <span class="fillslot">Mark</span> gulps.
    </p>
    <p>
      The others gather next to them and look down narrow stairway that must go in to the basement of the house.
      However,
      all they can see in the end of the stairs is complete darkness...
    </p>
    <p>
      But then they hear <span class="fillslot">footsteps</span> from <span class="fillslot">the terrace</span>. They are <span
        class="fillslot">getting closer</span>!
