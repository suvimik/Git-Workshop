    <p class="intro">
        On <span class="fillslot">Maple</span> street...

    <div class="story-area">
    <p>
      <span class="fillslot">Only some of the</span> the houses have put Halloween decorations up and <span class="fillslot">few</span> of them have lights on. One large house is lit with garish zombie heads with blinking eyes which look spooky in the darkness. On one lawn, there is a sign saying "No trick-or-treaters!" All three kids walk close to each other and <span class="fillslot">Cecilia</span> is holding on to their <span class="fillslot">turtle, Snap</span>. Earlier they were all <span class="fillslot">excited</span> and <span class="fillslot">curious</span> but now they are all <spanclass="fillslot">nervous</span>. Though none of them would admit it to each other, they are all <span class="fillslot">worried</span>.
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      "Maybe we should turn back?" <span class="fillslot">Cecilia</span> almost whispers. "It doesn't seem like we're gonna get a lot of <span class="fillslot">sweets</span> here. Besides, I don't like the <span class="fillslot">scary decorations</span>."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yeah... And look, that <span class="fillslot">cottage</span> looks like it's <span class="fillslot">deserted</span>", <span class="fillslot">Marin</span> whispers back pointing at a <span class="fillslot">dark house</span> on their left.
    </p>
    <p>
      But before the others can respond, the leaves of the nearby hedge ruffle and <span class="fillslot">rustle</span>.
    </p>
    <p>"<span class="fillslot">There's someone there!</span>", <span class="fillslot">Cecilia</span> screams. As they back off from the hedge they knock <span class="fillslot">Mark</span> over. What follows is <span class="fillslot">ten</span> seconds of utter chaos.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="fillslot">Mark</span> is the first to recover. As soon as they do, they realise <span class="fillslot">something's missing</span>.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Where is <span class="fillslot">Snap</span>?", <span class="fillslot">Mark</span> says sounding nervous and looking around.
    </p>
    <p>
      "There! On the porch!" <span class="fillslot">Cecilia</span> cries out pointing at the house on their left. And
      sure enough, <span class="fillslot">Snap</span> is standing at the porch seemingly curious about the <span class="fillslot">dark</span> house. The front door is slightly open, and before the trio manages to even call for them, <span class="fillslot">the cat steps into the doorway</span> and <span class="fillslot">disappears inside</span>.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh no....", <span class="fillslot">Cecilia</span> whispers, their face turning white. "This is not good..."
    </p>
    <p>
      "We have to go after <span class="fillslot">Snap</span>, there's no other option", <span
 class="fillslot">Marin</span> says trying to sound <span class="fillslot">brave</span> but looking just as
      nervous as <span class="fillslot">Cecilia</span>. Scared they head towards the house...
